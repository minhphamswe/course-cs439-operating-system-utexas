Homework 8

1. Is it fundamentally necessary to store on disk the information about
the unallocated disk sectors? Explain why.

2. Pooh Software Ltd. is selling a file system that uses a UNIX-like
file system with multi-level indexing.
For more reliability, the inode array is actually replicated on the disk
in two different places. The intent is that if one or a group of sectors
that are storing either replica of the array become bad, the system can
always recover from the replica. Discuss the effect of having this
replicated data structure on performance.

3. True or False. A virtual memory system that uses paging is vulnerable
to external fragmentation.

4. Some file allocation schemes limit the size of the file whether or not there is enough space for a larger file. Which ones and why?
    Linked
    Direct
    Contiguous
    Multi-Level index
    Extents
Which file allocation scheme that we studied is mot similar to paging?
Segmentation?
