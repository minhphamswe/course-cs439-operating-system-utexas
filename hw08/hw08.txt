1. Using the multilevel indexing scheme presented in class, and assuming that
each indirect block contains 1024 pointers, how big is the maximum file size
assuming disk blocks of size a) 1KB b) 4KB c) 8KB?

2. A user would like to use the file /u/sally/cs372/projects/results.txt. How
many disk accesses would it take the operating system to locate and begin
reading results.txt using the absolute path? Explain.

You may assume that each directory's entries fit in a single block.

3. The user has modified the file results.txt and now saves it to the hard
drive. List the steps the operating system takes to write the file to disk,
beginning with the write() system call and assuming the machine has a DMA
controller and so the OS uses DMA to communicate with the disk.

4. In the answer to question 3, you list the steps the OS takes to write a file
to disk. Now list the steps taken by the DMA controller and disk when they
receive the request(s) from the operating system to actually perform the file write.

5. In some early releases of an operating system that shall remain nameless,
when a file was deleted, its sectors reverted to the free list but they were
ot erased. What problems do you think may result from this? Why do you think
the blocks were not erased?
