Homework 5

1. In a 32-bit machine we subdivide the virtual address into 4 segments
as follows: 

    10-bit  8-bit   6-bit   8 bit

We use a 3-level page table, such that the first 10-bit are for the
first level and so on.
    1. What is the page size in such a system?
    2. What is the size of a page table for a process that has 256K of
    memory starting at address 0?

2. Pages have (at least) the following three bits associated with them:
the resident bit, the clock/reference bit, and the dirty bit. Describe
each bit and its use.

3. In class, we discussed that paging and segmented paging may increase
internal fragmentation. What is internal fragmentation? What steps could
you take to reduce it?

4. Belady's anomaly: Intuitively, it seems that the more frames the
memory has, the fewer page faults a program will get. Surprisingly
enough, this is not always true. Belady (1969) discovered an example in
which FIFO page replacement causes more faults with four page frames
than with three. This strange situation has become known as Belady's
anomaly. To illustrate, a program with five virtual pages numbered from
0 to 4 references its pages in the order: 

    0 1 2 3 0 1 4 0 1 2 3 4

    1. Using FIFO replacement, compute the number of page faults with 3
    frames. Repeat for 4 frames.
    2. Compute the number of page faults under LRU, the clock algorithm,
    and the optimal algorithm. What do you notice?

5. Question 9.19, page 852, B&O.
