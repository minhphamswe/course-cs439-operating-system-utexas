1. In Unix, the pipe(fd[0]) function call creates an I/O mechanism called a
pipe and returns two file descriptors, fd[0] and fd[1]. The files associated
with fd[0] and fd[1] are streams of data and are both opened for reading and
writing. Suppose pipe always returns the two lowest-numbered file descriptors
in the process's file descriptor table that are unused. Assume that initially
fdt[], the file descriptor table has three open entries: fdt[0] is the
default input device, fdt[1] is the default output device and fdt[2] is the
default error output device; all other entries of the fdt are NULL. What does
the fdt look like after each of the five following commands is executed in
sequence by the process?

1: pipe (&fd[0]);
2: close(fd[0]);
3: close(1);
4: dup(fd[1]);
5: close(fd[1]);

When might such a sequence of commands be useful?

You'll need to use the man pages for pipe, close, and dup to answer this
question.

2. Using the traceroute command, trace the hops a packet takes from one of
the UTCS machines to a website in Europe. Inspect the trace. What do you
notice? Do you see any machines you recognize? ISPs? Cities? Please be sure
to tell us what website you used.

Perform the trace again. How does the second time affect the output?

3. Describe the steps necessary to prepare a server to accept connections.
How does it accept a connection?

4. Which is the best (fastest) network on which to implement a remote-memory
read that sends a 100 byte packet from machine A to machine B and then sends
a 8000 byte packet from machine B to machine A?

  A network with 200 microsecond overhead, 10 Mbyte/s bandwidth, 20 microsecond latency
  A network with 20 microsecond overhead, 10 Mbyte/s bandwidth, 200 microsecond latency
  A network with 20 microsecond overhead, 1 Mbyte/s bandwidth, 2 microsecond latency
  A network with 2 microsecond overhead, 1 Mbyte/s bandwidth, 20 microsecond latency

5. In class, we covered the idea of remote procedure calls. We discussed difficulties encountered when one attempts to implement a remote procedure call. Name the four of the difficulties. There are additional complications when the procedure executes a system call. What are the complications and how might you fix them?
